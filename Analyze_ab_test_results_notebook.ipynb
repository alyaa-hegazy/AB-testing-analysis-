    "This logistic regression model predicts the response (conversion rate) based on three explanatory variables (country, pages and the interaction between them )\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Canada is used as the baseline category for the variable 'country' and treatment is used as the baseline for page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-From p-values, all the variables are statistically insignificant excpt for the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- The conversion rate is more likely to increase by 1.0665 in US more than Canada, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- The conversion rate is more likely to increase by 1.09424 in UK more than Canada , holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- The conversion rate for the old page is higher than that in the new group by 1.06977,  holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- If the user is from the UK and uses the old page, he/she is  0.9247 more likely to convert to the new page than if he/she is in Canada, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "7-  If the user is from the USA and uses the old page, he/she is 0.954 more likely to convert to the new page than if he/she is in Canada, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    " \n",
    " 8- There is an significant effect on the conversion rate when the user is in the UK. However, there is no significant effect between country and type of the page on the conversion rate, i.e. the interaction term is not significant."
